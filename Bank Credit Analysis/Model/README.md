## üöÄ Models Implemented
- **Random Forest**: Chosen for its robustness and ability to handle large datasets with higher accuracy.
- **XGBoost**: Known for its performance and speed, making it suitable for complex datasets.
- **Decision Tree**: Simple to interpret and visualize, though prone to overfitting.
- **AdaBoost**: Effective in boosting the performance of weak classifiers.
- **CatBoost**: Handles categorical features well and provides high accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model for classification tasks.
- **Extra Trees**: Similar to Random Forest but with some differences in the splitting of nodes.
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Simple and effective, especially for smaller datasets.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Simple and easy to implement, but can be computationally expensive.
- **Support Vector Machine**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and suitable for classification tasks.
