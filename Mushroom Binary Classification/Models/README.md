## Models Implemented
This project involves training and evaluating the following machine learning models:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Accuracy: 0.6213
   - A simple linear model used for binary classification.
   
2. **Random Forest**
   - Accuracy: 0.9920
   - An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together for a more accurate and stable prediction.
   
3. **Gradient Boosting**
   - Accuracy: 0.9288
   - An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each trying to correct the errors of the previous one.
   
4. **AdaBoost**
   - Accuracy: 0.8000
   - An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier by focusing on the hard-to-classify instances.
   
5. **Extra Trees**
   - Accuracy: 0.9915
   - Similar to Random Forest but builds multiple trees using random splits of all observations.
   
6. **XGBoost**
   - Accuracy: 0.9912
   - An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable.
   
7. **CatBoost**
   - Accuracy: 0.9871
   - A gradient boosting library that handles categorical features automatically and is highly efficient.
   
8. **LightGBM**
   - Accuracy: 0.9888
   - A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms and is designed to be distributed and efficient.

## Conclusion
