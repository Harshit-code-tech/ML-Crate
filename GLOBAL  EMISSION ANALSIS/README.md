 **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis**

## üéØ **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to analyze and forecast greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including CH4, N2O, CO2, NOx, ODS, and SO2, using various machine learning algorithms and geospatial analysis. The purpose is to understand the trends in emissions and identify key factors contributing to these trends, ultimately aiding in the formulation of policies for emission reduction.

## üßµ **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is compiled from multiple sources including governmental and environmental organizations. The data includes emissions of different gases from various countries over multiple years. 

- [CH4 Emissions]
- [N2O Emissions]
- [CO2 Emissions]
- [NOx Emissions]
- [ODS Consumption]
- [SO2 Emissions]

## üßæ **Description**

This project involves the collection, merging, and analysis of greenhouse gas emissions data from various sources. Machine learning models such as LSTM and ANN are implemented for time-series forecasting, while geospatial analysis is conducted to visualize the data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dimensionality and identify key patterns.
