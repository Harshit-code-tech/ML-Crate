# RSNA Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification Dataset

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this dataset is to provide medical imaging data for the classification of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. This dataset can be used to train machine learning models to predict spinal conditions.

## 🧵 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification/data).

## 🧾 Description

This dataset contains medical imaging data of lumbar spines. The images are labeled to indicate the presence and severity of degenerative changes. The dataset includes a variety of features such as patient age, sex, and other relevant clinical information.

## 📚 Files Included

- **train_images/**: Directory containing training images.
- **train.csv**: CSV file containing labels and metadata for the training images.
- **test_images/**: Directory containing test images.
- **sample_submission.csv**: CSV file providing a sample submission format for the competition.

## 🔢 Features

- **Image ID**: Unique identifier for each image.
- **Patient Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Patient Sex**: Sex of the patient.
- **Degenerative Grade**: Severity of degenerative changes (e.g., none, mild, moderate, severe).

## 🔍 Usage

The dataset can be used for:
- Training machine learning models to classify degenerative changes in lumbar spine images.
- Evaluating the performance of different models in predicting spinal conditions.
- Conducting research on medical image analysis and spinal health.

## 📢 Notes

- Ensure proper preprocessing of the images before feeding them into machine learning models.
- Follow the competition guidelines for the correct usage of the dataset in the Kaggle competition.
- Use the sample submission file to format your predictions for submission.
