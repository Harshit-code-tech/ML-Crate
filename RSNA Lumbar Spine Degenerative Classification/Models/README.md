## üöÄ Models Implemented

1. **Random Forest**: Selected for its ability to handle large datasets and provide feature importance.
2. **XGBoost**: Chosen for its high performance and scalability.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A basic model to establish a performance baseline.
4. **Gradient Boosting**: Implemented for its accuracy in classification tasks.
5. **AdaBoost**: Chosen for its ability to improve the performance of weak classifiers.
6. **CatBoost**: Selected for its efficiency with categorical data.
7. **LightGBM**: Chosen for its fast training speed and low memory usage.
