# Sepsis Survival Prediction - Models

## Models Implemented

### 1. Random Forest

**Description**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.

### 2. XGBoost

**Description**: XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting framework that is highly efficient and scalable, often used for structured data.

### 3. Logistic Regression

**Description**: Logistic Regression is a linear model that uses the logistic function to model the probability of a binary class.

### 4. Gradient Boosting

**Description**: Gradient Boosting builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.

### 5. AdaBoost

**Description**: AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

### 6. CatBoost

**Description**: CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical features automatically and efficiently.

### 7. LightGBM

**Description**: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework designed for efficiency with large datasets and low memory usage.

### 8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Description**: K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm where classification is based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.

### 9. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Description**: SVM is a supervised learning model that finds the hyperplane which best divides a dataset into classes.

### 10. Decision Tree

**Description**: Decision Trees are non-parametric supervised learning methods used for classification based on simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
